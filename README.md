Microfluidic applications in relation to a tilting chip platform
developed by Busek et al (UiO).

Currently contains three mini applications (under `appl/`)
that are based on the open-source simulator [DuMux](https://dumux.org/):

* Simulation of channel flow and reservoir in a tilting chip platform
* Simulation of Stokes flow in a 3D channel and computation of wall shear stress (WSS)
* Simulation of velocity and WSS in arbitrary channel cross-sections

and several helper scripts (Python).
